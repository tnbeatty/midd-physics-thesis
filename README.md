Installation
---

To use this document class, place `middphysthesis.cls` in your `$TEXMFHOME/tex/latex/custom/` directory. For example, on my mac, this directory can be found at:

	/usr/local/texlive/2012/texmf/tex/latex/custom

Then, at the top of any latex document, include the code `\documentclass[]{middphysthesis}`.
